# Use at your own risk and responsibility
# Backup your data before use

# Last update: 2016-03-15
# Version: 0.5.0
# Tested on OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan

# Description
# When installed as a Service, this AppleScript script can be used to automatically create a reminder (in pre-defined Reminder lists)
# from a selected email and flag the email.
# If you run the script against an email that matches an existing reminder it can mark the reminder as completed and clear the flag in Mail
